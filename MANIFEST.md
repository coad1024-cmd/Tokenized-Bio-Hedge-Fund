This is the "North Star" document for your project. Since you are moving from a standard DIY hobbyist to a **Quant-focused Token Engineering founder**, this experiment is framed as a **Cyber-Physical Economic System (CPES)**.

You are building an **Autonomous Agentic Node** that manages a high-stakes, resource-constrained physical asset in the real world.

# **Project Manifest: Bio-Alpha Autonomous Fund**

## **1. The Vision**

To create the first **Autonomous Biological Portfolio**, replicating the logic of the **$SOL Trophy Tomato**. The project treats a *Solanum lycopersicum* (Cherry Tomato) as a living data center. The AI (Claude Opus 4.6) must maintain the "uptime" (health) of the asset while optimizing for "Total Return on Carbon" (biomass growth vs. resource cost).

## **2. The Tech Stack (The "Infrastructure")**

The system is built on a three-tier architecture to ensure no single point of failure in your bedroom:

* **L1 - The Physical Hardware (The "Body"):**
  * **Enclosure:** A large 8-person trekking tent (~140 sq ft). We will utilize a **Partitioned "Alpha Zone"** (approx. 3x3 ft) lined with Mylar to concentrate light, CO2, and humidity.
  * **Energy:** 100W High-Efficacy LED (The "Sun"). Optimized for **PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation)** rather than just lumens.
  * **Metabolism:** CO2 injection system and a 12V irrigation pump.


* **L2 - The Edge Controller (The "Nervous System"):**
  * **Arduino Uno R4 WiFi:** Handles the raw analog signals from the soil, air, and gas sensors. It executes the physical "trades" (turning on a pump).
  * **Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB):** Acts as the local "Fund Server." It runs **Claude Code (Antigravity)**, manages the ledger, and hosts the vision processing.


* **L3 - The Frontier Intelligence (The "Manager"):**
  * **Claude Opus 4.6:** The Chief Investment Officer (CIO). It uses "Adaptive Thinking" to analyze photos and sensor data.
  * **Primary Language:** **Python 3.12+** (for Agentic Glue, hardware I/O, and MCP servers).
  * **Quant Bridge:** **Julia 1.10+** (reserved for high-fidelity biological modeling in Phase 3).

## **3. The Economic Logic (The "Quant" Edge)**

You are introducing an **$ALPHA Token Economy** to the project to simulate real-world capital constraints:

| Economic Concept | Biological Equivalent | Fund Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Capital Allocation** | Water, CO2, and Electricity | The AI "buys" these to keep the plant alive. |
| **Drawdown Risk** | Wilting, yellowing, or nutrient deficiency | Triggers a mandatory "High Effort" reasoning audit. |
| **Asset Yield** | New leaves, fruit count, and growth rate | Measured by AI vision; pays dividends in $ALPHA. |
| **Liquidation** | $ALPHA balance reaches 0 | The system powers down; the experiment fails. |

## **3. The Differentiability (The Quant vs. Meme Edge)**

Unlike the **$SOL SolTomato** project which focuses on viral narrative and meme coin hype, the **Bio-Alpha Fund** is a rigorous **experiment in Quantitative Biology and Resource Allocation**.

* **Alpha vs. Hype:** We optimize for **Total Return on Carbon** (Biomass/Cost), not social engagement.
* **Scientific Precision:** We use VPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit) and NDIR sensors to treat the plant as an engineering asset.
* **Internal Economy:** The **$ALPHA** token is a performant internal accounting unit for efficient resource management, not a speculative token (initially).

## **4. Operational Phases (The Roadmap)**

### **Phase 0: The Procurement Sprint (Current)**

*   **Goal:** Capital Expenditure (CapEx) tracking.
*   **Tasks:** Source the Pi 5, Arduino R4, and sensors.
*   **Success Metric:** All hardware verified and bench-tested by Antigravity.

## Phase 1: The Oracle & Architecture (Day 1-7)
- [ ] Establish Python-Serial Bridge (Arduino <-> RPi)
- [ ] Set up SQLite Ledger for $ALPHA token tracking
- [ ] Configure Pi 5 Vision capture (Daily Growth Photos)
- [ ] Calibrate sensors and verify data stream integrity

## Phase 2: The Autonomous Governor (The Run)
- [ ] Implement Claude Action Interface (Agent <-> Hardware)
- [ ] Launch "Observational Mode" (Data logging only)
- [ ] Hand over full control to Claude (Phase 2 Go-Live)
- [ ] Set up Twitter/Telegram bot for autonomous status updates

## **5. Why This Matters for Your Career**

This project is a perfect bridge between your interests. It demonstrates:

1. **Hedge Fund Logic:** Resource optimization under uncertainty.
2. **Token Engineering:** Building a balanced economy between sensors (data) and actuators (spending).
3. **Quantitative Analysis:** Managing a system based on hard data (VPD, PPM, Soil %) rather than "intuition."

> **Ruthless Mentor Check:** If you fail to calibrate your sensors properly in Phase 1, the AI will make decisions based on "bad data." In finance, we call this **Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO)**. If the sensor says the soil is wet when it's dry, the fund will go bankrupt (the plant will die).
