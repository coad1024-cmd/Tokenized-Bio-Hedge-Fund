This is the "North Star" document for your project. Since you are moving from a standard DIY hobbyist to a **Quant-focused Token Engineering founder**, this experiment is framed as a **Cyber-Physical Economic System (CPES)**.

You are building an **Autonomous Agentic Node** that manages a high-stakes, resource-constrained physical asset in the real world.

# **Project Manifest: Bio-Alpha Autonomous Fund**

## **1. The Vision**

To create the first **Autonomous Biological Portfolio**, replicating the logic of the **$SOL Trophy Tomato**. The project treats a *Solanum lycopersicum* (Cherry Tomato) as a living data center. The AI (Claude 3.x) must maintain the "uptime" (health) of the asset while optimizing for "Total Return on Carbon" (biomass growth vs. resource cost).

## **2. The Tech Stack (The "Infrastructure")**

The system is built on a three-tier architecture to ensure no single point of failure in your bedroom:

* **L1 - The Physical Hardware (The "Body"):**
* **Enclosure:** A large 8-person trekking tent (~140 sq ft). We will utilize a **Partitioned "Alpha Zone"** (approx. 3x3 ft) lined with Mylar to concentrate light, CO2, and humidity.
* **Energy:** 100W High-Efficacy LED (The "Sun"). Optimized for **PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation)** rather than just lumens.
* **Metabolism:** CO2 injection system and a 12V irrigation pump.


* **L2 - The Edge Controller (The "Nervous System"):**
* **Arduino Uno R4 WiFi:** Handles the raw analog signals from the soil, air, and gas sensors. It executes the physical "trades" (turning on a pump).
* **Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB):** Acts as the local "Fund Server." It runs **Claude Code (Antigravity)**, manages the ledger, and hosts the vision processing.


* **L3 - The Frontier Intelligence (The "Manager"):**
* **Claude 3.x:** The Chief Investment Officer (CIO). It uses "Adaptive Thinking" to analyze photos and sensor data.
* **Primary Language:** **Python 3.12+** (for Agentic Glue, hardware I/O, and MCP servers).
* **Quant Bridge:** **Julia 1.10+** (reserved for high-fidelity biological modeling in Phase 3).

## **3. The Economic Logic (The "Quant" Edge)**

You are introducing an **$ALPHA Token Economy** to the project to simulate real-world capital constraints:

| Economic Concept | Biological Equivalent | Fund Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Capital Allocation** | Water, CO2, and Electricity | The AI "buys" these to keep the plant alive. |
| **Drawdown Risk** | Wilting, yellowing, or nutrient deficiency | Triggers a mandatory "High Effort" reasoning audit. |
| **Asset Yield** | New leaves, fruit count, and growth rate | Measured by AI vision; pays dividends in $ALPHA. |
| **Liquidation** | $ALPHA balance reaches 0 | The system powers down; the experiment fails. |

## **3. The Differentiability (The Quant vs. Meme Edge)**

Unlike the **$SOL SolTomato** project which focuses on viral narrative and meme coin hype, the **Bio-Alpha Fund** is a rigorous **experiment in Quantitative Biology and Resource Allocation**.

* **Alpha vs. Hype:** We optimize for **Total Return on Carbon** (Biomass/Cost), not social engagement.
* **Scientific Precision:** We use VPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit) and NDIR sensors to treat the plant as an engineering asset.
* **Internal Economy:** The **$ALPHA** token is a performant internal accounting unit for efficient resource management, not a speculative token (initially).

## **4. Operational Phases (The Roadmap)**

### Phase 3: The Production Run (Go-Live)
*   **Goal:** Successful harvest with >$50K $ALPHA profit.
*   **Tasks:** Mount hardware in Alpha Zone, flash v1.1 Firmware, start live fund telemetry.
*   **Success Metric:** System running 24/7 for 30 days without manual override.

## **5. Project Status: COMPLETED PHASE 2.5**

- [x] **Simulation Suite**: 40+ Monte Carlo runs & Stress Tests complete.
- [x] **Ledger**: $ALPHA economy verified in simulator.
- [x] **Refactor**: Repository standardized for production.

**The system is now ready for deployment to the RPi 5 + Uno R4 WiFi hardware stack.**
